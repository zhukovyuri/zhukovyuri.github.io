I am an Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and a Research Associate Professor with the Center for Political Studies at the Institute for Social Research. My research focuses on the causes, dynamics and outcomes of conflict, at the international and local levels. My methodological areas of interest include spatial statistics, mathematical/computational modeling and text analysis.

I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Government at Harvard University. I also hold degrees from the Graduate School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University (M.A.) and Brown University (A.B.).

My research has been published (or is forthcoming) in the *American Political Science Review*, *American Economic Journal: Applied Economics*,*Foreign Affairs*, *International Organization*, *International Studies Quarterly*, *Journal of Comparative Economics*, *Journal of Conflict Resolution*, *Journal of Peace Research*, *Journal of Politics*, *Journal of Strategic Studies*, *Political Analysis*, *Political Geography*, *Political Communication*, *Quarterly Journal of Political Science*, *Comparative Political Studies*, *Conflict Management and Peace Science*, *Naval War College Review*, *Small Wars and Insurgencies*, *World Politics*, and several edited volumes and general-audience publications.
