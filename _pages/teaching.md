  This course introduces Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and their applications to political science and international relations. The course objectives are to enable enables students to work with GIS data structures and understand cartography, transformations, georeferencing, geocoding, and spatial analysis. I provide students with hands-on experience in using GIS software to visualize and analyze data. Applications include data on elections, armed conflict, crime, public infrastructure, and economic activity. The course meets once a week for three hours. This time is split between a lecture and a lab exercise, where students use GIS software to complete assignments.

  This course offers an introduction to the study of war in the modern world. I organize the lectures and readings into three modules: why wars begin, how wars are fought, and how wars end. In the first module, we cover major theories of war from international relations, and use them to explain the outbreak of a number of major international and civil conflicts. In the second module, we examine why some states are better at fighting wars than others, and explore the basics of military strategy in land, air, and naval warfare, as well as counterinsurgency. In the third module, we study conflict resolution, particularly the role of military intervention, peacekeeping, and negotiation. The course entails two 80-minute lectures per week, and one 50-minute discussion section. The sections emphasize activity-based learning through participation in interactive debates and simulations.
